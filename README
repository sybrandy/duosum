duosum

Usage
=====

duosum <filename>

Description
===========

This is, in short, a combination of md5sum and sha1sum.  Instead of generating
a single cryptographic hash, we generate two.  This is done because it is very
unlikely that two files will have the the exact same md5 and sha1 hash values.

These two algorithms were chosen only because they are fast.

The output of the program is written to STDOUT.

Purpose
=======

While this should prove useful for someone, this was an exercise in learning
to use Google Go.  I wanted to start with something simple, but also useful.
